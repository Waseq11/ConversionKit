Hello,
This is an Android application called 'ConversionKit' that is developed by me using JAVA on Android Studio.
It is about a conversion kit multi-page application with a simple and easy to understand UI. 
There is the Temperature converter which converts any given Celcius to Fahrenheit.
There is also the Metrix converter which converts any given Kilometers to Meters.
I used the MVC Design pattern to build this. Functions and different coding standards were mainted to make the application run
